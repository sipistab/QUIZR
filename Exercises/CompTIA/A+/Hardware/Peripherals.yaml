q_026:
  prompt: "What is the significance of a monitor’s aspect ratio?"
  answer: "It is the proportional relationship between the width and height of the display"

q_027:
  prompt: "What does ‘native resolution’ mean for a monitor?"
  answer: "The fixed number of pixels the monitor is designed to display optimally"

q_028:
  prompt: "What type of signal does an HDMI cable carry?"
  answer: "Digital video and audio signals"

q_029:
  prompt: "What is the typical pixel structure of an LCD display?"
  answer: "Each pixel contains subpixels of red, green, and blue to create color"

q_030:
  prompt: "Why is color calibration important for monitors?"
