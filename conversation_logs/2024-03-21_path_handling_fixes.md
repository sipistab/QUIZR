# Path Handling Fixes - March 21, 2024

## Issue Description
The path handling between the `list` command and `start` command was inconsistent, causing confusion when users tried to start quizzes using folder names or quiz names shown in the list output.

## Changes Made

### 1. Path Matching Logic (`data_manager.py`)
- Simplified path matching in `find_quizzes_by_path` method
- Added direct folder name matching
- Added matching for parts of the path (for cases like "A+")
- Kept quiz file name matching as a fallback

### 2. List Command Improvements (`cli.py`)
- Updated tree structure display to be consistent with search paths
- Fixed quiz loading to use full paths when getting question counts
- Added examples showing how to use the start command
- Made folder paths display match search behavior

### 3. Better Error Messages
- Added helpful error message when no quizzes are found
- Added examples of valid paths to use
- Added reminder to check the list command

## Testing
The changes were tested with various path formats:
- Folder names (e.g., "A+", "Network+")
- Quiz names (e.g., "Port_Numbers", "Hardware")
- Full paths (e.g., "CompTIA/A+")

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding fuzzy matching for quiz names
- Add path completion suggestions
- Consider caching quiz discovery results for better performance
